/** \brief A template used to allow unique_ptr<>() of nearly any type.
 *
 * This template is used with nearly any type representing a resource
 * that you would like to automatically delete (RAII) by using a
 * unique_ptr<>() definition.
 *
 * Note that it only works with resources which type is not a pointer.
 * For example, a file descriptor, which uses an `int`, works with this
 * class.
 *
 * For resources that have a pointer, use the raii_pointer_deleter instead.
 *
 * For example, a file descriptor can use this template class as follow:
 *
 * \code
 *   typedef std::unique_ptr<int, snap::raii_generic_deleter<int, -1, decltype(&::close), &::close>> raii_fd_t;
 *
 *   raii_fd_t fd(open("/tmp/test.tmp", O_RDWR));
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note
 * We actually offer the raii_fd_t as a default since it can be used by
 * many other implementations.
 *
 * To access the value, use the `get()` function of your pointer.
 * For example:
 *
 * \code
 *  raii_fd_t safe_fd;
 *  safe_fd.reset(socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP));
 *  std::cout << safe_fd.get() << std::endl;
 *  write(safe_fd.get(), "MSG\n", 4);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \warning
 * This class doesn't properly handle a case where an invalid resource can
 * be represented by more than one value. For a file descriptor, we expect
 * the invalid value to be exactlly -1. If a function call may return other
 * negative values, then this implementation currently fails to handle such.
 * It is your responsibility to fix the return value of the function or
 * use a two step initialization such as in:
 *
 * \code
 *  int r(this_func("open/something", "rw"));
 *  if(r < 0)
 *  {
 *      return; // it failed. r may not just be -1
 *  }
 *  raii_fd_t safe_fd(r);
 *  ...
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note
 * This template class is based on code found in this answer on Stackoverflow:
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15756960/using-unique-ptr-to-control-a-file-descriptor#48575395
 *
 * \param[in] T  The type being managed such as 'int'.
 * \param[in] null_value  The value representing "nullptr" for that type. For
 *                        a file descriptor this is -1.
 * \param[in] D  The type of the deleter function.
 * \param[in] deleter  The deleter function (i.e. 'deleter(p)' gets rid of `T p`).

     *
     * This class must be called "pointer" because the unique_ptr<>()
     * template definition checks the deleter using the following
     * code:
     *
     * \code
     * template<typename _Up>
     *     static typename _Up::pointer __test(typename _Up::pointer*);

     * As we can see it looks for a class named pointer. If it exists,
     * then it defines the type using that pointer class pointer operator
     * (i.e. the `\<type> operator *`) instead of using an actual pointer
     * (i.e. it uses `deleter::pointer` instead of the default `T *`.)
     *

     * operator function to retrieve the pointer (operator *).
