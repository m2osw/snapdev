/** \file
 * \brief Verify the escaping of regex special characters.
 *
 * At times you want to build a regular expression dynamically with parts
 * of the expression including user entered characters. Those character
 * usually need to be escaped to work properly in a regular expression.
 * For example, the period (.) character has a special meaning in a
 * regular expression (usually, all character except '\\n' or \\r').
 * For that character to represent a period in the source string of
 * the regular expression, it needs to be escaped (preceded by a
 * backslash character). This function does that on all the regular
 * expression characters.
 *
 * This file implements tests to verify that all the special characters
 * are indeed escaped.
