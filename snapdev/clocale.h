 * \brief For your application to use the "C" locale.
 *
 * In most cases, we want backend servers to be running with "no locale".
 * The "C" locale is generally the best representation of such.
 *
 * We offer locale support through our libutf8 library. That uses the
 * Unicode library which supports everything one can possibly need and
 * is thread safe. Anything else should use this function in main()
 * to cancel all sorts of issues (i.e. date conversions is one notorious
 * one).

 *
 * This function sets the locale() to "C" and the timezone to ":UTC".
 * This means the system will behave as if we had no locale and
 * where running with no timezone. This is quite practical for
 * services and also tests to avoid time conversions which should
 * be avoided since servers are accessed by people anywhere in the
 * world.
 *
 * \exception setup_error
 * If the setlocale() function call fails, then this error is raised.
 * This should pretty much never happen since the "C" locale is always
 * valid on all Unices.
