 * \brief Concatenate strings at compile time.
 *
 * At the moment, this is not super useful because it can only concatenate
 * two strings (although you can use concat<> any number of times, you have
 * to repeat it if you want to concatenate many strings).
 *
 * We would need to tweak this version to support any number of strings.
 *
 * Also, it does not work with our names.an strings since those are compiled
 * and not statically accessible at compile time. (See as2js project for
 * details about names.an files.)

 * \code

 *
 *     // concatenate hello and world at compile time
 *     //
 *     std::cout << snapdev::concat<hello, world>::value << std::endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * This template calls itself for all the characters found in S1 except
 * the null terminator.
 *
 * \tparam S1  left hand side string
 * \tparam S2  right hand side string
 * \tparam I1  position within S1 (you could skip some characters by using
 *             a number larger than 0)
 * \tparam I2  position within S2 (you could skip some characters by using
 *             a number larger than 0)
 * \tparam C1  character from S1 at position I1
 * \tparam C2  character from S2 at position I2
 * \tparam Chars  "extracted" characters
