# Introduction

The snapdev package includes a set of C++ headers we use in many of our
other Snap! C++ projects. At this time this is really only headers.
Later we may include some libraries.

The first 14 headers were first in the libsnapwebsites. We wanted to 
be able to use some of them in some of our contrib projects. Hence
the creation of this separate project.
